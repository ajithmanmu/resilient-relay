# Resilient Relay

A learning-focused project to deeply understand how resilient systems stay correct and available under retries, spikes, and partial outages.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Currently in setup phase** - See [LEARNING_PLAN.md](./LEARNING_PLAN.md) for the learning roadmap.

## What This Project Teaches

1. **Idempotency and deduplication** - How to safely retry without creating duplicate side effects
2. **Bounded queues and backpressure** - How to stop a traffic spike from taking down the service
3. **Timeouts, retry strategy, and exponential backoff with jitter** - How to avoid retry storms
4. **Dead-letter queues (DLQ)** - How to quarantine "poison" work without silently dropping it
5. **Basic observability** - How to expose stats/metrics to prove the service is healthy

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Follow the learning plan

Open [LEARNING_PLAN.md](./LEARNING_PLAN.md) and start with Phase 1: Reading.

After each reading, you'll implement that specific pattern step-by-step.

### 3. Run the service (once implemented)

```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start

# Tests
npm test
```

## Philosophy

This is a **learning project**, not a production system. The goal is to:
- Build each pattern from scratch to understand how it works
- Make trade-offs explicit (document what each pattern costs)
- Keep it simple enough to experiment with (adjust timeouts, queue sizes, retry counts)
- Build interview-ready explanations of why these patterns exist

**We will NOT add:**
- Production-grade monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Distributed system complexity (multiple processes, persistence)
- Advanced patterns (circuit breakers, rate limiting) until basics are solid
